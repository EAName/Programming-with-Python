The free breakfast was exceptional in my opinion; plenty of options with a helpful staff dedicated to the breakfast room. The staff was very friendly and very helpful.

Pioneer Square has a lot of ambiance, and the waterfront and stadiums are very close by, along with public transportation (Amtrak, light rail to the airport).

We wanted to her to get a good tour of the city and neighborhoods, to see if she might enjoy living there--so it was a business and sightseeing trip. The Pioneer Square Best Western Plus was a great choice for us, located in the historic part of downtown. It was about 20 minutes from the airport, which was an easy drive (though the train from the airport is a great option if you don't need to drive). The hotel was close to a lot of attractions, the free city bus ran a block away from the door (straight up to Pike's Market) and there were lots of good restaurants near by (check out Delicatos for great deli sandwiches, Cherry Street Coffee Shop for a cup of home roasted brew and breakfast, and Elliott Bay Oyster House for great seafood, a view and great service!). We were upgraded to a large room with 2 queen beds, desk, and small sofa as a Best Western club member. The bottled water and chocolate chip cookies were appreciated. The beds were comfy and linens were nice, the bathroom spotless, the room a great size, free wireless, and the continental breakfast was a great bonus. I got a great price online, though had some trouble booking through Southwest (with our flight), so when I called the hotel directly, they honored the online price. The parking was $20/day, which is less than many area hotels and though it is up the street in a parking garage, you got a card that gave you access in and out, even when the garage was closed at night to the public. There is a small parking zone in front of the hotel for loading/unloading luggage. There was a small amount of street noise, but it didn't affect our sleep. The staff was friendly and right on with their restaurant suggestions. We also did a walking tour of Seattle (Seattle By Foot City Tour-$20/person 2 hr tour)--a fun, informative and easy paced tour of the highlights of downtown Seattle with a great guide--highly recommended!

As I said, the shower was fine for me, with brand name soaps etc., and nice big fluffy towels that also looked new. My only negative comment would be that I would have liked a choice of feather pillows, instead of synthetic, but maybe that's asking too much.

Instead, we took the light rail from the Pioneer Square Station to SeaTac, which is three blocks (albeit uphill) from the hotel for a cheeeeeeeap $2.75. Just be sure to allow 40 minutes or so for the ride if you choose the light rail. Also, if you're looking for a great sandwich, my husband and I highly recommend Delicatus, which is a block up from the hotel on 1st Ave. I am still fantasizing about their Pav Diablo sandwich, yum. If you sleep late or want a second breakfast, Planet Java is one block over from the hotel on South Washington - we had a decent brunch there, eggs, turkey sausage and waffles. Nothing extraordinary, but tasty and filling. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Excellent value, pleasant staff, very clean, great location.\", \"Date\": \"October 18, 2011\"}, {\"Ratings\": {\"Service\": \"5\", \"Cleanliness\": \"5\", \"Overall\": \"5.0\", \"Value\": \"5\", \"Sleep Quality\": \"3\", \"Rooms\": \"4\", \"Location\": \"5\"}, \"AuthorLocation\": \"Spencerport, New York\", \"Title\": \"\\u201cGreat place to stay!\\u201d\", \"Author\": \"JCPCG\", \"ReviewID\": \"UR119331634\", \"Content\": \"On a road trip from San Diego to Seattle, we found the best hotel last!

The train/light rail is only a few blocks walk from the hotel though, and you can catch this to the city or a suburban mall if you have time.

After a 30 minute ride, I got off at the Pioneer Square station and walked the remaining 3 blocks to the hotel. Very cool. My single room was ready at 3pm as promised. Located on the 4th (top) floor, I discovered the room faced the adjacent double decked expressway that goes along the waterfront.

The daily service to replenish the towels and make the bed was excellent and not obtrusive.

Again - the light rail worked like a charm. I found the location to be terrific. Pioneer Square is interesting and has a bunch of history. Or I walked down 1st street - past the Seattle Art Museum (OK but not great) - on to the Pike Street Market (about 15 minutes walk - and absolutely terrific) and all the great restaurants nearby. Alternatively I could walk 1 block to Alaskan Way - the street that borders the waterfront, - and sight see down the waterfront at all the seafood restaurants, cruise excursions and Seattle Aquarium (terrific) located on that street. As for the Pioneer Square neighborhood - I never felt uncomfortable during the day or night as I was wandering around. I paid for my stay in advance without the possibility of any refund. A gamble that worked out for me and got me an average daily room price of about $140. Free wi-fi is available and worked great.

We specifically picked this property due to its proximity to Route 99--to get me where I wanted to go and to get him to his conference at Pier 66--and the perceived charm of the old Seattle area. But I won't say that it was a quick decision. Someone had posted a concern on this site about the homeless and noise of the area, which caused us to think long and hard before keeping this reservation out of safety concerns. We are both glad we stuck with it in the end and I'll explain more here if you wish to read it. First of all, we were right about the ease of getting around. Walking through Pioneer Square was a lot of fun. We found a great antiques shop, a diner with wonderfully fresh battered cod, and took the Underground Walking Tour. We used the Route 99 bus (temporary replacement for the Waterfront Trolley) repeatedly--to go shopping, to head to Chinatown, to go to the fish market, and to the waterfront. It stops right in right of the hotel for one direction, and within a short block walk for the other. Second, the customer service of this property was phenomenal. They were friendly and helpful in every way possible. If nothing else, that makes this property quite unique. Add that to the charm of the building and this was the nicest Best Western I've stayed in. Now, as to the homeless. Sad that there are people who have to live like that, and Seattle does seem to have their fair share. But contrary to what I had read, they are not dangerous, nor do they harass you on every corner. I think I saw maybe 3 or 4 actually begging to money in some way; the rest are just trying to get through life as pleasantly as possible. As to safety: While the latest we were out walking in the area was around 8:30 pm, I did not feel unsafe. I even ended up walking past the men's homeless shelter by myself one evening around 6pm and was pleasantly surprised to find that not a soul bothered me or even tried to approach me. As to the \\\"noise\\\", supposedly there is the traffic from the freeway on one side and bars on another. We requested a quiet room and was provided one on the interior of the hotel, so we heard none of that, if in fact it is as bad as someone writes. One more bonus--this hotel is less than 3 blocks from the entrance to the light rail/underground tunnel bus access. Straight to Macy's to shop on any bus in the free zone; and straight to SeaTac airport for only $2.50 per person on light rail.\", \"Date\": \"April 1, 2011\"}, {\"Ratings\": {\"Service\": \"5\", \"Cleanliness\": \"5\", \"Overall\": \"5.0\", \"Value\": \"4\", \"Sleep Quality\": \"5\", \"Rooms\": \"5\", \"Location\": \"5\"}, \"AuthorLocation\": \"Oostburg, Wisconsin\", \"Title\": \"\\u201cLove the Location, No Problemo\\u201d\", \"Author\": \"jwprice\", \"ReviewID\": \"UR102162989\", \"Content\": \"Location was great.

It's right across the street from the Seattle Underground tour (recommended!) and near restaurants and other amenities. This is a a small, old character hotel though, so you have to be prepared for what comes with that - a slow elevator, no fitness room or pool, no onsite dining other than the breakfast bar, minimal meeting or business facilities. This is not hotel to stay at on business or bring small children to. It reminds me of similar boutique hotels in San Francisco's Union Square, but quieter at night and with fewer other attractions nearby. The front desk staff at the B/W Pioneer Square are top notch. Very friendly and accommodating. Returning there after a day of knocking around, you really felt like you were coming home. The staff next door at the breakfast bar were less warm, but not obnoxiously so. The quest rooms are larger than you'd think in such an old property. This generosity of proportion does not extend to the bathrooms however, which are quite dinky. The room decor is in definite need of updating - you have mismatched bed and window coverings, both of which appear to date from the 80's, on top of old carpet. Our room was quite long, with perhaps eight feet of empty floor between the bed and and armoire in which perched a 26\\\" CRT television. You practically needed opera glasses to watch it. Updating the rooms and in-room amenities would greatly improve the property.

I made the reservation well in advance and paid for the room rentals in adnvance before cruise and after cruise stays. Since the ship arrived back in Seattle very early I contacted the hotel to see if they would store our luggage until our room became available. Michael K. responded promptly and upon arrival back into Seattle he made arrangements to have our luggage stored until our room was ready. The hotel itself is classic history. It is centrally located and found that check-in was very smooth and the rooms very well maintained. Large room with excellent bath, and just the right amount of furniture. We felt like we were back in the 50 or 60's. The room was spotless and very clean, as well as the bath. We were placed on the 4th floor for the arrival stay and the 2nd floor for the return cruise stay. After checkin on the return stay with in 30 minutes, housekeeping was knocking at the door to make sure we were happy with the room and asked if we needed anything or more towels. That was Ezekial. The rooms offer only a window air conditioner unit for cooling but it served the purpose well. The hotel offers a breakfast inclusive of the room rental fee and that was in a separate area of the hotel. There were lots of choices, just not hot meals, except the fresh waffles that the patrons can make themselves. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but many choices near by. We ate at an Asian restaurant right next door to the Hotel ....Julie's Garden, small quaint, and excellent asian food at such a reasonable price. For a drink near the hotel just next door, try thePioneer Square Saloon. The hotel offers free internet service in their boardroom. Their is a printer so you can print your airline boarding passes if you like. There is free bus service during the daytime hours which we used with helpful directions from Michael the front desk clerk. We used the Seattle Light Rail from the airport for just $2.50 each way per person saving lots of $$ vs.taxi or shuttle service into Seattle. $2.50 each vs. taxi of nearly $45.000 each way. It was so easy to use. Went to the American Idol 2010 Tour at Key Arena the night before the cruise using the free city bus serivce, then caught the monorail and light rail back to the hotel after the concert. The hotel is just 3 blocks from the light rail station, an easy walk. Upon arrival back from the cruise we took a taxi from Pier 66 to the hotel for a $6.00 for 2 people to transport our luggage. That afternoon we went to Safeco Field for a ML baseball game Mariner's vs Twins, and just walked down the street to the ballpark. Both Qwest Field ...Seattle Seahawks and Safeco Field ...Mariner's baseball are within walking distance. Also the waterfront and seafood restaurants just blocks away for foot traffic. Ate dinner the last night at the CrabPot on the waterfront (Alaskan Way) which was in our opinion .....very overrated. We enjoyed a free bus ride to Pike Street Market Saturday morning before the ballgame which is really something to see. Room price was an average of $200.00 per night.... a bit pricey for us, but well worth it in the end, considering we saved lots of $$$ for inner city transportation and transportation via taxi, shuttle or cruise ship bus to the pier. Yes, I would recommend the Best Western Pionner Square for either business of leisure visits. Lots to do in Seattle, and a very friendly city. Only concern and negative was the massive amount of homeless and transient people in the city. Feel this is a very bad image for the City of Seattle, and city fathers should certainly try to clean this problem up. For an historic hotel, close to many venues, consider the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. Friendly staff that is very helpful. You will not be disappointed. If we ever do another cruise from Seattle, we will consider staying here again.

The furnishings were top quality, including a three seater plush velvet lounge plus a single period style tapestried chair. Our bed was huge and comfortable, with bedside tables and lamps on either side. Plenty of storage space could be found in the large wardrobe and chest of drawers, and a large screen TV was enclosed in a wall unit. The light fittings were of the federation era, in beautiful cream coloured leadlight, with not only wall fixtures but also free standing lamps at either end of the room. In an alcove at one end was a round table with two twisted timber chairs, and as well there was a desk by the wall for workspace. The bathroom was also federation style with beautiful fittings, a large mirror, excellent water pressure from the shower which was housed in a large bathtub. The airconditioning was perfect and could be manually controlled by the guests in the room, and the large windows also opened, if you prefer fresh air from the bay. The room itself had 10 foot ceilings and all trimmings were of top quality red timber, with carpet throughout and tiles in the bathroom. The housekeeping staff were so quiet and unobtrusive that we didn't know they were around unless we saw them in the corridors. We had a nice continental breakfast each morning, which included all kinds of small pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, toasts and various breads, waffles which can be made by guests in the waffle maker, plus a variety of coffee and large assortment of teas. The dining room staff kept the tables cleared, the coffee urns full, and were obliging to any guests requirements. Our concierge organised taxies for us with ease, and was helpful with advice about the general area and any queries we had about restaurants or getting around Seattle. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants trouble-free accommodation within a nice environment where I believe the needs of even a demanding guest would be satisfied. We have travelled the world extensively and visited 15 different countries, some more than once, and Best Western, Pioneer Square, exceeded our expectations at a very reasonable price.\", \"Date\": \"June 25, 2010\"}, {\"Ratings\": {\"Service\": \"5\", \"Cleanliness\": \"4\", \"Overall\": \"5.0\", \"Value\": \"4\", \"Sleep Quality\": \"5\", \"Rooms\": \"5\", \"Location\": \"5\"}, \"AuthorLocation\": \"Victoria\", \"Title\": \"\\u201cWill Stay There Again\\u201d\", \"Author\": \"HLAE\", \"ReviewID\": \"UR68319608\", \"Content\": \"Nice room, very clean, great location.

We went on the underground tour which was awesome and where we had to meet was only about 25 steps away. Soooo close. Lots of restaurants near by. We walked to the piers easily and went to Pike Place Market. The market was about a 15 minute walk. No big deal. Walking there we got to see all the old historic buildings along the way.

When I expressed displeasure, I was offered no recourse, no discount, nothing. The $20/night parking fee was also an unpleasant surprise. Also upon arrival, the initial welcome left a rude, very negative feeling in general. We are a younger couple, and as such, it felt we were treated in a condescending manner.

Not friendly or welcoming at all. Once we made it to the room, we realized just how small it was. There was about one foot of clearance all around the bed, and barely enough room for luggage. Oh, and lets not forget the spectacular view of a brick wall outside. $200/night for this? Never again.

We were staying 3 nights and were informed our room had been upgraded. We were on the 4th floor with a small balcony. The room had double-paned glass which kept out most of the street noise, but if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs. I didn't need them. Our room was very clean, updated inside, and pleasant and the whole hotel is non-smoking which is an absolute joy. The Underground Tour (which I recommend) is only a block away. What this means, however, with at least 2 homeless missions within blocks away, is that the homeless congregate in that area as there are a multitude of tourists who come to see the old buildings and take the tour. I never felt endanged by any of them as we tromped back and forth, however, you have to ignor the requests for money. The parking structure suggested by the hotel seems much more secure than other parking nearby. You can park elsewhere if you want. The parking rate is a flat fee and you can come and go as much as you want/need. There is a city bus that stops right in front of the hotel that will take you over to the International District (which has an amazing store with all things Asian and many Asian fast food stands within). We were able to use buses in the \\\"free zone\\\" to get to almost everywhere we wanted to go for free. It was impossible to try and park near Pike Place Market, so the buses were very helpful--although you must walk several blocks from the free bus dropoff point. Also the free buses along the front shoreline road stop right in front of the hotel. The breakfast was okay. Yogurt and hard boiled eggs for protein and bagels/cream cheese and make-it-yourself waffles provide the carbs. There is a Starbucks a block away and several small restaurants in the immediate area. Overall, I was very pleased with this hotel as it is a great value for the money. My only complaint is the one elevator. Unlike where I live, there is nothing that states when it was last inspected inside the elevator itself and it had a bounciness to it that made us feel a bit wary. That said, however, it worked and it would not deter a recommendation or future stay. I gave a 3/5 for location because the location has both pluses and minuses.

As a bonus to history and ghost story lovers, the Pioneer is the only hotel to be found here, the first area to be established by the pioneers of Seattle. If you listen carefully, you will hear great stories about both these elements of old Seattle. Yes, there is quite a bit of panhandling in the area and it became tiresome.

Don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t go if you are looking for the cookie cutter hotel of the big chains, this is more of a boutique hotel. The \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153free\\u00e2\\u20ac\\ufffd breakfast was more along the lines of a small European hotel without the meat and hard rolls, which matched the feel for the whole hotel. In my opinion the hotel would be fit right in with the boutique hotels of any major European city. Right next to the hotel is a nice saloon which severed mostly local beers and wines, but had the atmosphere of a local \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153gasthaus\\u00e2\\u20ac\\ufffd in Germany or a local pub in England. If you are in Seattle with some free time I would advise you take the \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Underground Tour,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\ufffd which is about a block from the hotel. Not overly impressive however very informative. Just around the corner from the hotel up on First Avenue there is a nice little jazz club that has reasonably priced meals and great music, if you like jazz that is. The hotel is with easy walking distance of the waterfront and its associated eateries. Just a short walk north on First Avenue is the famous Pikes Market where you can buy fresh fruit, meat, flowers and fish. If you go to the Market don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t forget your camera as the range of colors is outstanding. Speaking of cameras, vist Kerry Park, which is north of the Space Needle, where you get a wonderful view of the city; I think it is the same view you see from window of Frasier\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s window from the TV show of the same name. One doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t need a rental car to get there however it is a \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153hike\\u00e2\\u20ac\\ufffd up the last few blocks, trust me on that as I hiked it once and about half way up my legs and I agree that I was out of shape and should have taken the rental car. (Testosterone will kill you every time.) They say in the winter when the air is fresh and clear you can see Mt. Rainer in the back ground behind the Space Needle; however I was there in the summer so I just got a hazy view of Mt. Rainer. For the camera buffs I would advise you go to the park right after sun down so you can get a view of the Space Needle and the rest of Seattle all lit-up. If you want to change your daily wear visit Utilikilts on Pioneer Square. They can outfit you with a daily wear kilt in no time. I was much temped to buy one; however, well to be honest I chickened out.

Great to be able to have a hearty breakfast before you're heading out for a day's sightseeing... My only criticism is that there may have been a lot of dust under the beds or somewhere, because my allergies were going nuts, but I can't say for sure that was the hotel's fault; it might have been something else triggering my allergies. Also, the parking is a block away (pay parking) but you can pull up in front of the hotel to unload your luggage, check in etc, and then move the car. And the parking lot does have in/out priveleges - you get a pass from the hotel and that way can come and go as you please. You pay for the pass as part of your hotel bill, so you don't have the hassle of paying separately. (I searched online for hotels with parking included, and there didn't seem to be any in this price range, so just remember to add on $20/day for parking.

We looked for a hotel that was close enough to walk to our favorite spots within the city and decided to stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. It is within walking distance from both the Seattle Aquarium, Pike place market, and many great restaurants. Upon first arriving I had trouble working the card key lock but the bell hop was very friendly and assisted us getting into our room to relax. He finished showing us our room and quietly left us to start our night. Our wake up call came in on the dot which, for my hotel experience was rare but preferred. The continental breakfast was served pipping hot! Fresh Belgian waffles with coffee for my fiancee and myself. They had fresh fruit, yogurt and much more which we couldn't stuff ourselves with. However, I did sneak some fruit for later in the day. The staff was very polite and the food was never empty nor cold. After a day out we returned to a well turned down room. The front desk was more then happy to sneak a bottle of champagne into our room while we were out so I could surprise my fiancee per my request by phone. We relaxed in our room the remainder of the night. Our room had a balcony overseeing the front entrance which made it nice to watch the foot traffic of the city. After spending weekends at other hotels in the past, their prices never were justified with what we received. All of the Amenities at Pioneer Square Hotel were more then adequate and my fiancee will most definitely return. The room was superb, the staff was more then helpful, friend and went well above and beyond. If you plan on going to Seattle ANYTIME soon, I would highly recommend sneaking into this wonderful hotel and staying awhile.

What we didn't know before we got there is that there is an elevated freeway that runs above the part of the waterfront that is immediately west of the hotel. That area of the waterfront is, as a consequence, very noisy and not very attractive. We were there in July and it was hot enough that we needed the air conditioning provided by the room's older window unit. Thankfully, the air conditioner blocked the freeway noise. I wouldn't stay there at other times of year with nothing to block the noise. Since other reviewers describe their rooms as quiet, maybe there are quieter rooms further down Yesler street from the freeway. Or maybe some people are better at tuning out that kind of noise.

You step out the door of the hotel and turn left walk about a block and your at the ferry terminal on the waterfront. You walk out the hotel door and practically next door is the bus stop for FREE bus service within the Downtown core. The Klondike Gold Rush museum is also in the area. They sometimes offer free walking tours that include a trip to the top of the Smith Tower (originally the tallest building on the West Coast). If you walk north up 1st Ave about 6-7 blocks & at the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) and the Pike Place Market. The rooms were small, but the hotel was built in the early 1900. The room was immaculate, and because of something we were given an upgrade to a deluxe room with city view. We got in about 9pm and walked to the waterfront. Ivars is open until late. We found a really good deal. They extend their Happy Hour on Fridays til closing. Well drinks, wine are $3.00.

Every thing was fine for us, excellent quality-price: - walking distance to most of the best attractions such as Pioneer Square (historical square, but a bit spooky day & night), Pike Place Market (so lively, we met Rachel, the pig, and many many other Rachel all over the center... cute!), the Waterfront, the Business District, etc. - free bus to the other main attractions - free wireless Internet in our room (we highly appreciated!) - very courteous, and helpful personnel - free & light breakfast, very practical. The room was comfortable, big enough for 2 persons, tastefully decorated but not well organized (nice but too big furniture), especially the bathroom as someone else mentioned. Before checking at the hotel, we visited the University District, which is far from the center but worthwhile to visit by car (we came from Vancouver with a rented car - a 3 h drive). Immediately after checking (our room was not ready), we returned our car. The rented car office was, again, within walking distance from the hotel. We were glad to have done that because although the Hotel offers parking spaces, they were far from the hotel, and expensive, and we do not need a car to visit Seattle. Public transport seems very well organized at least during the week. Seattle is a pleasant city, easy to visit; people were really nice and helpful with us, tourists (as in Vancouver by the way). Terminal 30, where our ship, Sun Princess, docked was close (a short taxi drive), not far from the stadium. But do not think about walking there: it seems to me a labyrinth of highways...

It is very charming and cozy, and is within a few yards of great restaurants and bars. In fact, out of all the meals we ate, the restaurant next door, Al Boccalino's, was the best. They provide room service for the hotel, and they have some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Somewhat pricey, but it was SO good. Hotel staff were friendly, but not the most knowledgeable of all the questions I asked (such as, can they help with reservations for the Victoria Clipper, what bus # do we take to go to Ballard, etc.).

We loved the old wood center staircase. Breakfast was included and everyone was happy with waffles, toast, cereal, and an egg meal. Location was great. We could walk to shops and restaurants as well as transportation. Pike Market was a reasonable walk. We enjoyed the nearby Gold Rush Museum. Very, very happy with our stay.

Non view rooms actually just look at a wall so might be bad if you are claustrophobic. DO NOT stay by the elevator. We were there mid afternoon and were given the room right behind the elevator when there were still lots of rooms left to book out. Even when the elevator didn't run, it banged constantly. We were able to move rooms the following day. It's an old building so the hallway floors creak. Also, we were there on a Sat. night and had young people partying around us. Sunday was much quieter.

If you are looking for a conveniently-located downtown hotel for a reasonable price, this hotel is for you. It is located within a couple blocks of the Bus tunnel which gets you downtown for free during the day and also provides a way to get to the airport. However, it is close enough to walk to the waterfront attractions, Pike Place Market, the ballpark, the stadium, and the center-city of Seattle. We did not get a rental car because of the location and availability of public transportation. The hotel is in a historic building. The rooms are quite nice and are not \"cookie-cutter\". There are not many amenities to the hotel itself, though there is a breakfast room and \"free\" Continental breakfast was included in our room rate. There is a pub next door (same building) as well as several other shops. A good Italian restaurant (Al Boccalino) is less than 100 feet away, and a variety of shops and restaurants or pubs are very close. The \"Seattle Underground\" tour is located nearby and a couple of ferries are within sight out the front door of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They greeted us as we walked by the front desk every time. We would like to get back to Seattle next year to see more sights and catch a ballgame. This hotel will be our first choice.',\n",

The historic hotel has retained its historic atmosphere without sacrificing quality. My son and I stayed for 5 days here in January. Being off season, it may have problems (like noise) that we did not run into. The room was compact but very livable and very clean. Our room faced an internal courtyard and was very quiet, especially for a downtown hotel. The free breakfast was exceptional in my opinion; plenty of options with a helpful staff dedicated to the breakfast room. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. The location is a little ways from the financial/shopping part of downtown Seattle, but a rather easy walk. Pioneer Square has a lot of ambiance, and the waterfront and stadiums are very close by, along with public transportation (Amtrak, light rail to the airport). Lots of good restaurants and pubs within a block or two. This was one of those rare hotel experiences where I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. Just keep in mind that it's almost 100 years old and not a 5* luxury hotel, and you won't be disappointed.\",\n",

We enjoyed the small breakfast as we were looking for something to hold us over til we got to Pike's market. The staff was helpful and even though the parking is off sight it was not that inconvenient. You are allowed to park in front for 15 minutes to get your bags up to your room. We ate at the Italian eatery next door and found it romantic and good food but a little over priced and they will charge you for everything so be careful. You have to ask.

We wanted to her to get a good tour of the city and neighborhoods, to see if she might enjoy living there--so it was a business and sightseeing trip. The Pioneer Square Best Western Plus was a great choice for us, located in the historic part of downtown. It was about 20 minutes from the airport, which was an easy drive (though the train from the airport is a great option if you don't need to drive). The hotel was close to a lot of attractions, the free city bus ran a block away from the door (straight up to Pike's Market) and there were lots of good restaurants near by (check out Delicatos for great deli sandwiches, Cherry Street Coffee Shop for a cup of home roasted brew and breakfast, and Elliott Bay Oyster House for great seafood, a view and great service!). We were upgraded to a large room with 2 queen beds, desk, and small sofa as a Best Western club member. The bottled water and chocolate chip cookies were appreciated. The beds were comfy and linens were nice, the bathroom spotless, the room a great size, free wireless, and the continental breakfast was a great bonus. I got a great price online, though had some trouble booking through Southwest (with our flight), so when I called the hotel directly, they honored the online price. The parking was $20/day, which is less than many area hotels and though it is up the street in a parking garage, you got a card that gave you access in and out, even when the garage was closed at night to the public. There is a small parking zone in front of the hotel for loading/unloading luggage. There was a small amount of street noise, but it didn't affect our sleep. The staff was friendly and right on with their restaurant suggestions. We also did a walking tour of Seattle (Seattle By Foot City Tour-$20/person 2 hr tour)--a fun, informative and easy paced tour of the highlights of downtown Seattle with a great guide--highly recommended! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to be back to Seattle soon!\",\n",

The bathroom is quite small however, and only has a shower, which is fine by me, although the shower can double as a shallow, small tub but for people who want a full size tub this would be a problem. As I said, the shower was fine for me, with brand name soaps etc., and nice big fluffy towels that also looked new. My only negative comment would be that I would have liked a choice of feather pillows, instead of synthetic, but maybe that's asking too much. I found the price to be excellent as well for a downtown hotel, and would definitely stay here again if I am in the area. A very pleasant stay, at a very pleasant hotel. Recommended.\",\n",

We were upgraded to a room with a huge king size bed, lots of room and a large square tub, not too high, that had a seat built into it. Nice. :9) This place is clean and recently redone. The staircase is something they are proud of and the panelled conference room with 24/7 use of two pc's. I brought over some pho from a restaurant across the street and the young fellow at reception was pleased to bring me a large bowl from the hotel to eat my pho. Nice touch, fellow. Our room was on the inside of the hotel on the airshaft, but we heard almost nothing of the other guests.\",\n",

The hotel is situated just minutes from the piers, and in walking distance to the downtown core. No need to take a taxi, everything is really close. The room, although facing the water and a busy street, was quiet and clean! The bed was very comfortable and he bathroom had a great size.The breakfast was very good and open early, a good start to the day with lots of different choices. If there's one negative at all, it's the availability of parking, the hotel doesn't seem to have a parking lot, the public parking is available but very expensive (we paid $36) for one night. (although there might have been a surcharge because the Sounders had a game that night). Being located so close to the stadiums and downtown, this hotel will be my choice from now on for every trip to Seattle in the future! To all staff: Thank you very much for making us feel welcome! We'll be back!\",\n",

       "   'Content': \"We stayed at the Best Western Pioneer Square for two nights at the end of our Seattle trip (we stayed with friends for the first half). It was great! The room was big enough for the two of us, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and fairly spacious, as well as restocked each day. I liked the old charm of this historic building. The free breakfast was basic, but was plenty for us (cereal, fruit, and waffles, if you wanted). Since we did the Underground Tour on our first day in Seattle, we were acquainted with the Pioneer Square area, and getting around was not a problem. During our stay at the Best Western, we walked to Columbia Tower, Seattle Aquarium, and Pike Place. We managed to take the bus to the Space Needle without issue as well - the bus stop is a block away. We took a taxi back from the Space Needle ($8-9 with tip), and noticed the fare to SeaTac was $32. Instead, we took the light rail from the Pioneer Square Station to SeaTac, which is three blocks (albeit uphill) from the hotel for a cheeeeeeeap $2.75. Just be sure to allow 40 minutes or so for the ride if you choose the light rail. Also, if you're looking for a great sandwich, my husband and I highly recommend Delicatus, which is a block up from the hotel on 1st Ave. I am still fantasizing about their Pav Diablo sandwich, yum. If you sleep late or want a second breakfast, Planet Java is one block over from the hotel on South Washington - we had a decent brunch there, eggs, turkey sausage and waffles. Nothing extraordinary, but tasty and filling. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Excellent value, pleasant staff, very clean, great location.\",\n",

The hotel itself is lovely and historic but updated in all the right places. The location can't be beat. It is a block from the piers for dinner and ferry rides and at the edge of the historic district for walking around old Seattle. The staff is very pleasant and uber helpful. Beds were comfy. We had a king at the front of the hotel overlooking Yesler. The room was small but the location and the price more than made up for it. Walked everywhere from here and found a few pubs serving local brews. Definitely worth it!\",\n",

I was originally worried about noise being downtown, however, room 419 on the front of the hotel, was an excellent choice and was quiet, extremely clean, well serviced and very comfortable. The continental breakfast included with the rate was good - cereals, boiled eggs, pastries, toast, jams, good coffee, juice and you could make a fresh waffle too - more than enough to get you going for a day. The underground tour runs from Pioneer Square a block away. It is a very interesting tour, lots of humour, worth doing. We liked being in the historic part of town - walked down First Avenue to Pike Market and the main town shopping centre. The train/light rail is only a few blocks walk from the hotel though, and you can catch this to the city or a suburban mall if you have time. We walked to the station with our luggage and caught the light rail to Seatac airport and at $2.75 a person this was a great value deal in saving on cab fare. The hotel overall and the great helpful staff exceeded our expectations.',\n",

The only negatives are that about 3 blocks away are the shelters and missions for the homeless. The walls of the hotel are a little thin; we didn't hear people talking, but did hear the plumbing whenever a nearby toilet was flushed or shower turned on. The hotel is about a block away from an elevated highway, so it was a little noisy during the weekday mornings. Otherwise, the hotel was a great place to stay and a pretty good value.

This was not the case with this hotel, the room was large, light and airy and the bathroom had a very unusual shower that also doubled as a bath. The first impression of the hotel was not that good, there is a lot of dark wood panelling in reception and the lighting is a bit gloomy, however check in was both speedy and friendly, with the welcome news that the hotel had free wifi. The breakfast which is included in the room rate is good, always great to make your own waffles. The down side of the breakfast room is that it can be a bit cramped when busy and I'm afraid some guests have been quite careless and spilled things on the floor and stained the carpet - it really could do with a good shampoo just to tidy it up. The hotel is in a perfect location, near to the water front, so handy for ferries. For a bargain rate of just $2.75 you can take the light railway from the airport and the walk the block and a half to the hotel. Would definitely stay here again, also plenty of good eating places in walking distance.\",\n",

Our room was spacious, very, very clean and the breakfast the next morning was Continental along with waffles. We walked to the Space Needle for dinner and rode public transportation back - really easy. The next morning, the Victoria Clipper, Pier 65, to Victoria was just 1 mile from the hotel. On returning to Seattle from Victoria, we stayed a 2nd time at the Best Western (great, clean accommodations again) and took Amtrak the next morning (0.3 miles from the hotel) to San Francisco. We would definitely go back to the Best Western on a return trip to Seattle.',\n",

We took a shuttle from the airport but could have easily taken the light rail for $2.75 had we not had our 84 yo grandmother. The hotel was perfectly located to walk to lots of restaurants, bars, the Underground tour, Pike's Place Market, the Space Needle if you are adventurous, an easy 4 minute walk to the light rail, and best of all it's right on the water and easy to walk all the great seafood restaurants and the Pier. Every room was a little different, we had four and they were all shaped different with different coffee pots (in-laws had a Keurig, Grandmother had a balcony) and the morning breakfast was really nice, fresh waffles, bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, water, coffee and juice.

We enjoyed discovering another part of town after staying near the Space Needle before our cruise. The location of the Best Western hotel had some more grungy type bars, but we found some nicer restaurants. I couldn't imagine a couple over 60 or a familyenjoying its local very much.(Nearer the Spcae Needle seems better), but we found the area interesting and I enjoyed the underground tour which was minutes from the hotel, Most important-if you are able bodied-there is a metro for $2.00 to the airport with a stop 5 minutes walk away from the hotel(slighly uphill) that will save you a $50 limo ride!\",\n",

       "   'Content': 'I stayed at the Best Western Pioneer Square for 3 days (4 nights). I found the hotel to be a very good combination of location, amenities and price. I arrived at the Sea-Tac airport and walked to the light rail station that is adjacent to the huge parking garage by Terminal D. After a 30 minute ride, I got off at the Pioneer Square station and walked the remaining 3 blocks to the hotel. Very cool. My single room was ready at 3pm as promised. Located on the 4th (top) floor, I discovered the room faced the adjacent double decked expressway that goes along the waterfront. However the double paned windows did an excellent job of keeping out the noise from the traffic. The room was good sized and more that sufficient for just me. The daily service to replenish the towels and make the bed was excellent and not obtrusive. The breakfast - included in the room cost - was extensive including just about everything except eggs and bacon. When I checked out, I simply walked to the light rail station (I got there at 6:45am - with no problems) and within 1.25 hours of walking out of the hotel, I was sitting in the departure lounge for my flight home. Again - the light rail worked like a charm. I found the location to be terrific. Pioneer Square is interesting and has a bunch of history. Or I walked down 1st street - past the Seattle Art Museum (OK but not great) - on to the Pike Street Market (about 15 minutes walk - and absolutely terrific) and all the great restaurants nearby. Alternatively I could walk 1 block to Alaskan Way - the street that borders the waterfront, - and sight see down the waterfront at all the seafood restaurants, cruise excursions and Seattle Aquarium (terrific) located on that street. As for the Pioneer Square neighborhood - I never felt uncomfortable during the day or night as I was wandering around. I paid for my stay in advance without the possibility of any refund. A gamble that worked out for me and got me an average daily room price of about $140. Free wi-fi is available and worked great. Bottom line: a very attractive combination of good hotel, great location, at a terrific price.',\n",

The rooms are very old-school, but it does add to the charm of the place. They serve a very good continental breakfast in the morning wit waffles, fruit, pastries, cereal, and bage. Location is excellent with the LINK train to the airport only a couple of blocks away and downtown within easy walking distance. One small service issue that I had, on 2 of the three mornings, I requested wake-up calls. I did not get the call the first morning and it was 1/2 late the second morning. I was in Seattle on leisure, and only had the calls so that I would not sleep the day away. Ultimately, not a big deal, but under different circumstances, it could have been a big issue. All in all, an enjoyable stay.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'I stayed in the Pioneer Square Hotel for 5 nights last week. When i arrived, i was warmly greeted by \"Randy\" who could not do enough to welcome me. He was so pleasant, it was a great first impression. I stayed on the 2nd Floor towards the back of the hotel. The room was very spacious and had all the amenities you would expect from a really good hotel, flat screen tv, iron, free wi-fi, coffee maker, desk and a very comfortable king bed. Maid service was good, and although i can be messy, the room was as good as new every time i came back after a day out around Seattle. The free continental breakfast was great also, and filled me up for the rest of the day. Particularly, the waffle making machine meant i could have a tasty hot waffle and maple syrup every morning, FAB. Location wise, you cannot get much better. It is close to funky jazz clubs, bars and restaurants. It is also really close to the waterfront and harbour cruises. There is also a bar next door and an Italian restaurant on the corner. It is also close to the baseball and football fields. I went to see the Seattle Mariners and had a great night with only a short walk back. Great hotel for the price. So glad i booked this hotel instead of splashing out double the price on something which could not deliver any more. Great place to see Seattle from.',\n",

Some of the rooms are a little small but this is a historical building. They do have larger rooms and they are great. I just wish they had a hot tub so I could relax after a long day at court! I loved the fact that each day I got a hello when I came in and a good luck when I left! They always made me feel like family! I must admit I love the fact that I get a knock on my door to find out if I need extra towels at the end of the day. Nice touch! The staff was always willing to help me! Never did I ever get anything but OUTSTANDING customer service. I am the owner of a small business and if I had staff like this my business would go crazy! I know all of the names of the front desk and each of them deserves a raise/bounes for all of the care and attention I and my family was given.

       "   'Content': 'I was on a \"leisure trip\" while my husband was on business. We specifically picked this property due to its proximity to Route 99--to get me where I wanted to go and to get him to his conference at Pier 66--and the perceived charm of the old Seattle area. But I won\\'t say that it was a quick decision. Someone had posted a concern on this site about the homeless and noise of the area, which caused us to think long and hard before keeping this reservation out of safety concerns. We are both glad we stuck with it in the end and I\\'ll explain more here if you wish to read it. First of all, we were right about the ease of getting around. Walking through Pioneer Square was a lot of fun. We found a great antiques shop, a diner with wonderfully fresh battered cod, and took the Underground Walking Tour. We used the Route 99 bus (temporary replacement for the Waterfront Trolley) repeatedly--to go shopping, to head to Chinatown, to go to the fish market, and to the waterfront. It stops right in right of the hotel for one direction, and within a short block walk for the other. Second, the customer service of this property was phenomenal. They were friendly and helpful in every way possible. If nothing else, that makes this property quite unique. Add that to the charm of the building and this was the nicest Best Western I\\'ve stayed in. Now, as to the homeless. Sad that there are people who have to live like that, and Seattle does seem to have their fair share. But contrary to what I had read, they are not dangerous, nor do they harass you on every corner. I think I saw maybe 3 or 4 actually begging to money in some way; the rest are just trying to get through life as pleasantly as possible. As to safety: While the latest we were out walking in the area was around 8:30 pm, I did not feel unsafe. I even ended up walking past the men\\'s homeless shelter by myself one evening around 6pm and was pleasantly surprised to find that not a soul bothered me or even tried to approach me. As to the \"noise\", supposedly there is the traffic from the freeway on one side and bars on another. We requested a quiet room and was provided one on the interior of the hotel, so we heard none of that, if in fact it is as bad as someone writes. One more bonus--this hotel is less than 3 blocks from the entrance to the light rail/underground tunnel bus access. Straight to Macy\\'s to shop on any bus in the free zone; and straight to SeaTac airport for only $2.50 per person on light rail.',\n",

The building is older, but has been splendidly updated and we wanted for nothing. Breakfast was perfectly acceptable and included; only gourmet snobs and greedy gluttons could complain! Parking is limited and the garage is a block away, but the system works very well. If there are no more parking spots left, there is an open lot across the street at $13 overnight. Pioneer Square is ever so slightly rough around the edges, but we felt perfectly safe. This is now my go-to hotel for Seattle visits!!',\n",

I opted to stay here because of the above and their no pets and no smoking policies. The only negative point I have is that the only heat source in the room was a very noisy window mounted fan. I had to turn it off during the night as there is no way I would have been able to sleep with it on. Do not be put off staying here because of the location. I felt safer in Pioneer Square than parts of downtown (2nd, 3rd & 4th Ave street corners for example). I would not have a problem staying here again but think I'll opt for somewhere a bit more modern.\",\n",

Chose the hotel for its location near the Art Museum and Pikeâ€™s Market (6-8 blocks). Overall, itâ€™s nicely decorated in keeping with the historic neighborhood, but our room was very small. Not enough floor space to even put up the luggage rack or ironing board. The furniture was decent quality, if a bit too large for the space. The bathroom counter was 3/4ths occupied by coffee maker, ice bucket and glasses. Our room card key was temperamental, and changing keys didnâ€™t help. A phone in the hallway to contact the front desk was inoperative. We slept very well, no noise from other guests, and the raised highway nearby sounded like ocean surf, not disturbing. The continental breakfast is very generous, with an excellent waffle maker. The free parking garage, however, is treacherous, with lanes so narrow that turning its blind corners could mean running head-on into a car in the opposite direction. Descending on one corner I had to pull to the side, stop, then back up to return to the lane in order to avoid a collision. If youâ€™ve got a larger car, park somewhere else! Spaces are first-come-first-serve anyway, and we went up 5 floors before finding a spot. The historic neighborhood felt safe, although since it was cold weather there may have been fewer street people around. If youâ€™re willing to put up with a few quirks in an older building, this is a good location for seeing downtown Seattle. You donâ€™t need to walk steeply uphill to access the market and shops overlooking the waterfront. Itâ€™s a half dozen blocks from an Amtrak station and also near the ferries.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'We came to Seattle to see the Picasso exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum. While parking is not onsite; there is parking located in a parking garage about 2 blocks away at $20 per night. We did find that the hotel\\'s location was such we were able to walk to the museum...about 3 or 4 blocks away. The hotel is also located within the \"free bus\" section of the city so that if we had wanted to go to any of the many attractions that downtown Seattle has to offer, it would have been very easy for us to do so. The waterfront is also within walking distance...about a block away. The hotel is a small, boutique style hotel and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The king bed was very comfortable and while our room was on the small side, our friends\\' room across the hall was much larger although their room had a very odd-sized square tub that was quite awkward while the tub in our room was \"normal\" sized. Diversity in rooms, I guess you could say. The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast with waffle machine, yogurt, various cereals and fruits, etc. The hotel does not have an in-house fitness center but daily passes for the Xplore Fitness Club are available at the front desk for a per day fee. Located just a couple of blocks from the hotel, it comes complete with all the up-to-date weight, free motion equipment and over 20 different kinds of cardio machines. This wasn\\'t an amenity that we took advantage of so can\\'t speak to it. While there isn\\'t an in-house restaurant, there is a restaurant next door to the hotel which will provide limited room service should you wish it. We appreciated the free high speed internet as well as the free local phone calls. This was a hotel where we did NOT feel they were out to gouge us for every cent possible unlike other higher-priced hotels we have stayed at. The staff of the hotel were all outstanding! They all were very friendly and helpful and went beyond our expectations. They all seemed very sincere in their desire to ensure any of our questions were more than adequately answered. I can\\'t remember any recent stay in any hotel where I was so impressed with everyone on the staff of the hotel as I was with the staff of the Pioneer Square Best Western! The hotel was very quiet until about 5 am when the garbage trucks began their pick-up. I was having trouble sleeping so found the noise disconcerting. However, our friends were sleeping soundly and the trucks did not disturb them. This, of course, is not an issue within the hotel\\'s control. Other than this, there did not seem to be any street noise during the night. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting good value in Seattle.',\n",

We both slept very well and we never heard a sound from beyond the room. In the morning, the continental breakfast was very nice.

       "   'Content': 'If you want to explore Seattle\\'s Pioneer Square district, there\\'s no better hotel to do it from than the Best Western Pioneer Square located at the heart of this neighborhood. It\\'s right across the street from the Seattle Underground tour (recommended!) and near restaurants and other amenities. This is a a small, old character hotel though, so you have to be prepared for what comes with that - a slow elevator, no fitness room or pool, no onsite dining other than the breakfast bar, minimal meeting or business facilities. This is not hotel to stay at on business or bring small children to. It reminds me of similar boutique hotels in San Francisco\\'s Union Square, but quieter at night and with fewer other attractions nearby. The front desk staff at the B/W Pioneer Square are top notch. Very friendly and accommodating. Returning there after a day of knocking around, you really felt like you were coming home. The staff next door at the breakfast bar were less warm, but not obnoxiously so. The quest rooms are larger than you\\'d think in such an old property. This generosity of proportion does not extend to the bathrooms however, which are quite dinky. The room decor is in definite need of updating - you have mismatched bed and window coverings, both of which appear to date from the 80\\'s, on top of old carpet. Our room was quite long, with perhaps eight feet of empty floor between the bed and and armoire in which perched a 26\" CRT television. You practically needed opera glasses to watch it. Updating the rooms and in-room amenities would greatly improve the property. These are minor complaints, and on the whole we really enjoyed our stay.',\n",

We were assured our room by 3 PM and true to their word, our deluxe room was a pleasant surprise. For an old hotel, the room was better than expected. It was large and brightly appointed with clean, modern carpeting and nice furniture. The beds were comfortable and the lighting good. The bathroom is stocked with high end Neutrogena toiletries. The TV is old and the picture a tad fuzzy. Letâ€™s hope new flat screens are on the way. Parking is at the Butler Garage, a 12 story parkade located a block and a half from the hotel. Not bad considering the age and location of the hotel. Our room was quiet, even though it faced the main street. We slept well. If you have many electronic gadgets which may need charging, bring a power bar as electrical outlets are scarce. Other TripAdvisor reviews of poor internet service proved true. It was intermittent at best. We called the 1-800 service and received little help. We were on vacation, so not such a big deal but a business traveller may not share our sense of charity. The gentleman who checked us out was genuinely concerned and promised to follow up with their provider. The breakfast room has about 12 small clothed tables and the food is excellent.',\n",

We walked 1 block from the hotel down to Alaska way, the street that stretched accross the waterfront (Pier 50) and walked to Ivar\\'s where the best (white) clam chowder in the world is served. Try the fish and chips with a cup of clam chower both use the same receipe from 1938 when the restaurant opened.

       "   'Content': \"The Best Western at Pioneer Square was a real treat for us staying before and after an Alaskan cruise. I made the reservation well in advance and paid for the room rentals in adnvance before cruise and after cruise stays. Since the ship arrived back in Seattle very early I contacted the hotel to see if they would store our luggage until our room became available. Michael K. responded promptly and upon arrival back into Seattle he made arrangements to have our luggage stored until our room was ready. The hotel itself is classic history. It is centrally located and found that check-in was very smooth and the rooms very well maintained. Large room with excellent bath, and just the right amount of furniture. We felt like we were back in the 50 or 60's. The room was spotless and very clean, as well as the bath. We were placed on the 4th floor for the arrival stay and the 2nd floor for the return cruise stay. After checkin on the return stay with in 30 minutes, housekeeping was knocking at the door to make sure we were happy with the room and asked if we needed anything or more towels. That was Ezekial. The rooms offer only a window air conditioner unit for cooling but it served the purpose well. The hotel offers a breakfast inclusive of the room rental fee and that was in a separate area of the hotel. There were lots of choices, just not hot meals, except the fresh waffles that the patrons can make themselves. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but many choices near by. We ate at an Asian restaurant right next door to the Hotel ....Julie's Garden, small quaint, and excellent asian food at such a reasonable price. For a drink near the hotel just next door, try thePioneer Square Saloon. The hotel offers free internet service in their boardroom. Their is a printer so you can print your airline boarding passes if you like. There is free bus service during the daytime hours which we used with helpful directions from Michael the front desk clerk. We used the Seattle Light Rail from the airport for just $2.50 each way per person saving lots of $$ vs.taxi or shuttle service into Seattle. $2.50 each vs. taxi of nearly $45.000 each way. It was so easy to use. Went to the American Idol 2010 Tour at Key Arena the night before the cruise using the free city bus serivce, then caught the monorail and light rail back to the hotel after the concert. The hotel is just 3 blocks from the light rail station, an easy walk. Upon arrival back from the cruise we took a taxi from Pier 66 to the hotel for a $6.00 for 2 people to transport our luggage. That afternoon we went to Safeco Field for a ML baseball game Mariner's vs Twins, and just walked down the street to the ballpark. Both Qwest Field ...Seattle Seahawks and Safeco Field ...Mariner's baseball are within walking distance. Also the waterfront and seafood restaurants just blocks away for foot traffic. Ate dinner the last night at the CrabPot on the waterfront (Alaskan Way) which was in our opinion .....very overrated. We enjoyed a free bus ride to Pike Street Market Saturday morning before the ballgame which is really something to see. Room price was an average of $200.00 per night.... a bit pricey for us, but well worth it in the end, considering we saved lots of $$$ for inner city transportation and transportation via taxi, shuttle or cruise ship bus to the pier. Yes, I would recommend the Best Western Pionner Square for either business of leisure visits. Lots to do in Seattle, and a very friendly city. Only concern and negative was the massive amount of homeless and transient people in the city. Feel this is a very bad image for the City of Seattle, and city fathers should certainly try to clean this problem up. For an historic hotel, close to many venues, consider the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. Friendly staff that is very helpful. You will not be disappointed. If we ever do another cruise from Seattle, we will consider staying here again. It was a real treat and a step back in time, since it is an historical hotel.\",\n",

       "   'Content': \"I recently stayed here for 1 night over the September Long Weekend. This is possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. It is grungy, doesn't smell nice, in a terrible location - its next to a bad area (my gf was yelled at twice by bums on the street coming out of the hotel); the service staff (particularily the Manager) is rude, and tried to overcharge us when we went to leave - we had booked for 3 nights then want to check out after one night given the conditions (our opinion). For Less than what this place costs you can go down the street to near Safeco field (hotel will be obvious) and stay in a beautiful new, modern hotel with a pool, hotub and beautiful rooms, also a safer location. We thought we were getting a good room as Best Western is typically a safe bet - we recently stayed in their New York location which was pretty good. Even if they didn't overcharge me by $61, I would think it is only fair to let other travellers know about this place. Avoid if possible. One positive - it has a waffle iron, which isnt terrible.\",\n",

The hotel provides a free breakfast but after the first day of trying the continental breakfast we decided to skip it the rest of the trip. It was difficult navigating to get our breakfast in a little space with many people. The breakfast was standard continental fare. The hotel is about 7 blocks from Pike Place Market and downtown. Many of the streets are steep and uphill. If I chose to do it over, I would have chosen a hotel closer to the Market. Overall we had a good stay at the Pioneer.',\n",

The gentleman on the front desk greeted us with a smile, and informed us that he had upgraded us to one of the beautiful rooms on the 4th floor of the hotel. This was a very pleasant surprise, and very much appreciated. Our room overlooked a quiet street, by way of 4 huge double windows along one wall. The furnishings were top quality, including a three seater plush velvet lounge plus a single period style tapestried chair. Our bed was huge and comfortable, with bedside tables and lamps on either side. Plenty of storage space could be found in the large wardrobe and chest of drawers, and a large screen TV was enclosed in a wall unit. The light fittings were of the federation era, in beautiful cream coloured leadlight, with not only wall fixtures but also free standing lamps at either end of the room. In an alcove at one end was a round table with two twisted timber chairs, and as well there was a desk by the wall for workspace. The bathroom was also federation style with beautiful fittings, a large mirror, excellent water pressure from the shower which was housed in a large bathtub. The airconditioning was perfect and could be manually controlled by the guests in the room, and the large windows also opened, if you prefer fresh air from the bay. The room itself had 10 foot ceilings and all trimmings were of top quality red timber, with carpet throughout and tiles in the bathroom. The housekeeping staff were so quiet and unobtrusive that we didn't know they were around unless we saw them in the corridors. We had a nice continental breakfast each morning, which included all kinds of small pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, toasts and various breads, waffles which can be made by guests in the waffle maker, plus a variety of coffee and large assortment of teas. The dining room staff kept the tables cleared, the coffee urns full, and were obliging to any guests requirements. Our concierge organised taxies for us with ease, and was helpful with advice about the general area and any queries we had about restaurants or getting around Seattle. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants trouble-free accommodation within a nice environment where I believe the needs of even a demanding guest would be satisfied. We have travelled the world extensively and visited 15 different countries, some more than once, and Best Western, Pioneer Square, exceeded our expectations at a very reasonable price.\",\n",

       "   'Content': 'My mother, my best friend and myself took a 4 day trip to Seattle. We wanted to stay at a hotel within walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The Best Western Pioneer Hotel exceeded our expectations. We had a lovely room on the 2nd floor with two beds and a little juliette balcony. The front desk staff were accommodating and the bellmen were great on giving us direction. We were close to everything we wanted to see and were able to walk everywhere. Their parking lot (we were told) was a block and a half away. Well really it was just a 2 min walk and a lot closer than we imagined. The \"blocks\" were not \"true\" blocks. The garage was completely secure with a gate that closed at night, so only people with a pass could have access. We felt very comfortable leaving our car there. Yes, the area had some homeless around, but we were never bothered by them and felt completely safe at night. There was even a Starbucks 20 feet away for our morning latte! We went on the underground tour which was awesome and where we had to meet was only about 25 steps away. Soooo close. Lots of restaurants near by. We walked to the piers easily and went to Pike Place Market. The market was about a 15 minute walk. No big deal. Walking there we got to see all the old historic buildings along the way. The whole area is wonderfully historic including the Pioneer Square Hotel. We will definately stay at the Pioneer Square Hotel again if we go back to Seattle.',\n",

And what a pleasant surprise! I loved the history, the pictures of old Seattle hanging in the lobby and the stairs - the Crowne Plaza had nothing on this place. And it was a block from the waterfront - shops, ferries, restaurants - and a short bus ride from Seattle Center. And they also had an abundant continental breakfast - make-it-yourself waffles, bagels, cold cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc, etc. Crowne Plaza had squat - except if you wanted to pay for it! The room was clean and well-kept, and with the recently stained woodwork, seemed as if it had all been remodeled recently. Last, but not least, the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The only issue I had was with the recently stained woodwork/furniture - which was beautiful - but the odor was pretty bad. Luckily, the windows opened so I was able to air the place out.\",\n",

Restaurants and bars are close for evening meals and nightcaps; I felt safe on my own. I discovered the Pioneer Square underground Transit Tunnel stop 2 blocks up from the hotel, and the free bus from there to the International District (Uwajimaya just across the street) one stop away. This is the same station for the train to the airport, about a half hour trip for $2.50 (only detriment a long walk to the terminal at the end). The hotel is super for staff, service, quiet, convenience, and proximity to downtown and airport by foot or public transportation. I couldn't have asked for more.\",\n",

Also on the last night of our stay, my father got propositioned by a homeless woman on his way back from the parking garage alone. The bell men at the hotel were very friendly, and the rooms were clean. Breakfast was average, and nothing to write home about. Then again though, it was free. If we were to go to Seattle again, I would spend more money to stay somewhere else. The savings that this hotel offers compared to the more expensive ones downtown were not worth it.

My only complaint is that there was no hotel parking available by the time we checked in, so had to park on the street which was less than desirable. The hotel is quite old and has so much character. Our room was one of the smallest in the hotel, but it was fine for a one night stay. The rooms were clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. A free paper awaited us on our Sunday morning, which we read enjoying the complimentary hotel breakfast. It is close to the Interstate, but we did not notice much noise within the hotel. It is also within walking distance to the harbour and Pike's Place market. We headed to Anthony's Pier for dinner on Saturday night.

The included breakfast was an extended Continental style with make-your-own waffles that were very good. The hotel is located in an 1890's street-front building that is on the National Register -- very cozy surroundings two blocks from the Elliott Bay waterfront, 1/2 block from Pioneer Square, and a comfortable walk to the stadiums. The hotel is also within the Free Ride zone - we caught a free bus over to the Westlake Center, picked up the Monorail (2 bucks) to the Space Needle. Took about 15 minutes total.\",\n",

I'd probably choose this hotel if I were to do it again. The location was good if you don't mind a little walking. The pier was about a five to ten minute walk and the market was about 10 minutes. A great BBQ place is about a minute walk away in the square. I felt a little uncomforable walking alone at night as a single female but during the day it was fine.

       "   'Content': 'I would not stay here again, nor recommend it. Where to startâ€¦ Well, Iâ€™ll admit it was our fault to reserve so last minute on a busy weekend, but the rate of $200 tax for the first night compared to $95 the next night almost seemed criminal. The value was simply horrible. Iâ€™m kicking myself now for paying so much for a room that was clearly no better than one at Motel 6. And if the cost wasnâ€™t bad enough, upon arrival we were informed it was also the smallest room in the entire hotel, something they did NOT mention over the phone. When I expressed displeasure, I was offered no recourse, no discount, nothing. The $20/night parking fee was also an unpleasant surprise. Also upon arrival, the initial welcome left a rude, very negative feeling in general. We are a younger couple, and as such, it felt we were treated in a condescending manner. For example, the parking garage key â€“ I was told â€œItâ€™s worth $50 to us, so itâ€™s worth $50 to you, lose it and it will be charged to your credit cardâ€�. Not friendly or welcoming at all. Once we made it to the room, we realized just how small it was. There was about one foot of clearance all around the bed, and barely enough room for luggage. Oh, and lets not forget the spectacular view of a brick wall outside. $200/night for this? Never again. We settled for it anyways due to a long day of driving and just generally being too tired to make an issue of it. Amenitiesâ€¦ All your Best Western standards were there. The complimentary breakfast was your usual bagels, etc. The wireless internet though, was extremely slow and almost unusable. Overall, this is an old hotel albeit well maintained, but in a less desirable area of downtown Seattle (everything is uphill walking from this hotel). Itâ€™s a fair distance from any attractions, and also right next to a major viaduct, so I assume some rooms are likely quite noisy. $95/night (peak) sounds acceptable, anything more and youâ€™re paying far too much. I expected better from a Best Western.',\n",

Pioneer Square is more-or-less the heart of what\\'s happening in Seattle, right in the middle of or within easy walking distance of an endless array of sights and shopping. A great, attractive, comfortable, clean room and bathroom, and even fresh apples waiting in the room. My location request had been incorporated with no difficulty. Because of a harried exit from home, I had forgotten to pack my very necessary hair spray in my checked luggage, and I forgot toothpaste as well. Due to airline difficulties, I arrived too late to buy these items. When I asked for toothpaste, they had it, which was not surprising. But I then said, jokingly, \"I don\\'t suppose you have any hair spray back there, do you?\" And the young man said, \"I don\\'t know. I\\'ll look.\" He opened the cabinet door behind him, and there was a short row of little hair spray bottles! ! ! Doing the happy dance, for sure! There is a restaurant next door which serves lunch and dinner - - and I think they deliver as \"room service\" until 10:00 p.m. Did not use that service. Free breakfast is available in the hotel breakfast room, with a nice selection of \"continental\" items - - plus do-it-yourself waffles! When I go back, I\\'ll go down for breakfast a little earlier, so as not to get stuck in the \"waffle line.\" Apparently we all thought everyone else would be eating early, but there was a late rush just before the serving stopped. Everyone still got everything they wanted, but we had to take turns! ! ! (The second morning we were catching the train to Vancouver, and ate breakfast on the train.) Look at the hotel website, and you will see this thoroughly updated hotel in a great location, with really nice people operating it.

This is a terrific older hotel that is located in the old original downtown area of Seattle; an area that the city could do a lot more to improve. We were staying 3 nights and were informed our room had been upgraded. We were on the 4th floor with a small balcony. The room had double-paned glass which kept out most of the street noise, but if you\\'re a light sleeper, bring earplugs. I didn\\'t need them. Our room was very clean, updated inside, and pleasant and the whole hotel is non-smoking which is an absolute joy. The Underground Tour (which I recommend) is only a block away. What this means, however, with at least 2 homeless missions within blocks away, is that the homeless congregate in that area as there are a multitude of tourists who come to see the old buildings and take the tour. I never felt endanged by any of them as we tromped back and forth, however, you have to ignor the requests for money. The parking structure suggested by the hotel seems much more secure than other parking nearby. You can park elsewhere if you want. The parking rate is a flat fee and you can come and go as much as you want/need. There is a city bus that stops right in front of the hotel that will take you over to the International District (which has an amazing store with all things Asian and many Asian fast food stands within). We were able to use buses in the \"free zone\" to get to almost everywhere we wanted to go for free. It was impossible to try and park near Pike Place Market, so the buses were very helpful--although you must walk several blocks from the free bus dropoff point. Also the free buses along the front shoreline road stop right in front of the hotel. The breakfast was okay. Yogurt and hard boiled eggs for protein and bagels/cream cheese and make-it-yourself waffles provide the carbs. There is a Starbucks a block away and several small restaurants in the immediate area. Overall, I was very pleased with this hotel as it is a great value for the money. My only complaint is the one elevator. Unlike where I live, there is nothing that states when it was last inspected inside the elevator itself and it had a bounciness to it that made us feel a bit wary. That said, however, it worked and it would not deter a recommendation or future stay. I gave a 3/5 for location because the location has both pluses and minuses. I would definitely stay here again.',\n",

       "   'Content': \"Seattle is a tourist-friendly city, and Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel was a great base from which to enjoy it all. The hotel is located within walking distance of the Waterfront, in the middle of Pioneer Square's attractions, and just a few blocks from Safeco/Qwest Fields. One block up is 42 floor Smith Tower, with a 360 degree view observation deck. And 1st Avenue, one block up from BW, has all kinds of good restaurants. The New Orleans Creole Restaurant on 1st had terrific music by the New Orleans Quintet on Monday night, along with wonderful, reasonably priced food. There is a 'free bus' area to a lot of Seattle's attractions, including Pike Market, Sculpture Garden, Monorail to the Space Needle, etc. Several stops are within a few blocks of Best Western. One bus stops right in front of the hotel. Pioneer Square BW has a great free morning breakfast - make your own waffles w/strawberries, bagels, yogurt, fruit, etc. The lobby is comfortable and our room/bathroom were fine. There was no street noise at night, even though you're in close proximity to the highway. We parked our car in the Butler Garage, 1-1/2 blocks away, and left it there for the 3 day stay. No need to drive, with the free buses, monorail, cheap bus fare out-of-area. The concierge at the BW door on Tuesday morning was extremely helpful with directions and suggestions. We're looking forward to going back, and staying at the Pioneer Square Best Western when we do. Be forewarned that all of Seattle is overpriced, but once you adjust to that, you will love the city!\",\n",

       "   'Content': \"My critera for finding a hotel in Seattle was that it be near the Amtrak station, as we were traveling by train, and this hotel was the closest one I found. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I checked in. Not only is it a beautifully restored old hotel, but it is located within a 10 minute walk of the Amtrak station in a nice historic area of the city. The room was one of the largest rooms I have ever been in in a hotel, and the king size bed was gigantic! The room was nicely furnished with high-speed internet, a coffee pot, hair dryer, iron, and the usual assortment of shampoos, soaps, etc. I wish our stay could have been longer, because the hotel was located in a very interesting and fun area, as well as being convenient to the [free] public transportation to get to other parts of the city. The hotel staff was very pleasant, and upon our checkin, gave us a map of Seattle which enabled us to easily find our way around. The free continental breakfast was very good and much appreciated; make-your-own waffles as well as cereal, muffins, bagels and toast toast were available, served in a cozy room next to the lobby. The lobby, altho small, was comfortable. Because I was only there overnight, I didn't have time to check out what amenities the hotel offered, so I am not sure about many of those things. The photo and the appearance of the hotel doesn't do the hotel justice; you need to go into the lobby to see what a gem it is. I would definately recommend this hotel to a friend.\",\n",

I found it to be beautifully furnished, clean, quiet, and everything I needed for a relaxing stay. The staff was very helpful with luggage, directions, recommendations, etc. Even though we arrived on a very busy Friday afternoon, it was easy to pull up directly in front of the hotel, unload the luggage, check in, and get the car to the parking garage located just a few blocks away. The staff made this all very smooth. (On a side note, everything is within walking distance, a free bus ride, or a cab ride away, so I would leave the car at home and save the $20 a day in parking if you can.) Breakfast was not elaborate but good and plenty was available (fresh waffles, hard boiled eggs, bagels, muffins, cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.) The hotel was a bit of a hike from the Convention Center, but I found the 30 minute walk each morning pleasant. There are also free buses a few blocks away if you don't like to walk that far. Personally, I enjoyed being away from the activity of the large convention hotels at the end of the day and found it the perfect place to stay. When visiting Seattle again, I will definitely stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square.\",\n",

We were very satisfied with the room and price, facilities were good, location excellent - at the end of Downtown, handy for the docks, shops and Pioneer Square district. You can reach it from the harbour area (e.g. cruise, Victoria Clipper ports) by the free downtown trolley. Breakfast was decidedly basic (but at least included), and the first morning very overcrowded - I think a group had come just ahead of us. Business centre allowed me to check internet as necessary without difficulty. Room was on a corner and quite near the overhead freeway but you could also see the water with a little effort! Noisy with the window open but it wasn't so hot that we needed to open it much. Staff willing to be helpful but not obtrusive. Main complaint was that when we wanted to go to the airport they tried very hard to persuade us to take a town car for $5 more than a taxi: but I really couldn't understand why I should want to.\",\n",

It had all the amenities and efficiency of a chain hotel with the decor and ambiance of a historic hotel. The location is perfect if you plan to take the ferries or water taxis frequently. It is also very close to excellent restaurants on the waterfront and in Pioneer Square. There is a great view of the city from the observation deck at Smith Tower, just barely up the street. Pikes Market is also a little over a half mile away as well- a pleasant walk. To get to Seattle Center, we walked about half a mile to the monorail station, then took the monorail, which was a fun experience. We also took a cab to Seattle Center one day when we were in more of a hurry (about $10). So, if you absolutely have to be right in the middle of the market/shopping area or near the convention center, this might not be the place for you, but otherwise everything about this hotel was convenient for getting around Seattle. We also liked the fact that it is relatively small, with only four stories. We almost never had to wait for the elevator, and could just easily take the stairs, which made getting in and out of the hotel a breeze. If you are very sensitive to any sounds while you are trying to sleep, you may not want a \"city view\" room, as the hotel is near the freeway and there is a \"saloon\" next door, so you will hear road noise and people sitting at the outside tables. But that is part of staying downtown, and it was really not an issue for us.',\n",

The Underground Tour, the Pier 52 ferry to Bainbridge Island, eclectic shopping, sports stadiums, nature and historic walks, and lively bars and restaurants are literally only a block or two away. Don't miss a tour of the, nearby, public library. It's amazing. Also, a major bus stop is nearby. (We didn't even need to rent a car, thus saving $20.00 per night for parking). As a bonus to history and ghost story lovers, the Pioneer is the only hotel to be found here, the first area to be established by the pioneers of Seattle. If you listen carefully, you will hear great stories about both these elements of old Seattle. Yes, there is quite a bit of panhandling in the area and it became tiresome. However, the good completely outweighed the bad.\",\n",

       "   'Content': 'The Best Western at Pioneer is a great little hotel. Donâ€™t go if you are looking for the cookie cutter hotel of the big chains, this is more of a boutique hotel. The â€œfreeâ€� breakfast was more along the lines of a small European hotel without the meat and hard rolls, which matched the feel for the whole hotel. In my opinion the hotel would be fit right in with the boutique hotels of any major European city. Right next to the hotel is a nice saloon which severed mostly local beers and wines, but had the atmosphere of a local â€œgasthausâ€� in Germany or a local pub in England. If you are in Seattle with some free time I would advise you take the â€œUnderground Tour,â€� which is about a block from the hotel. Not overly impressive however very informative. Just around the corner from the hotel up on First Avenue there is a nice little jazz club that has reasonably priced meals and great music, if you like jazz that is. The hotel is with easy walking distance of the waterfront and its associated eateries. Just a short walk north on First Avenue is the famous Pikes Market where you can buy fresh fruit, meat, flowers and fish. If you go to the Market donâ€™t forget your camera as the range of colors is outstanding. Speaking of cameras, vist Kerry Park, which is north of the Space Needle, where you get a wonderful view of the city; I think it is the same view you see from window of Frasierâ€™s window from the TV show of the same name. One doesnâ€™t need a rental car to get there however it is a â€œhikeâ€� up the last few blocks, trust me on that as I hiked it once and about half way up my legs and I agree that I was out of shape and should have taken the rental car. (Testosterone will kill you every time.) They say in the winter when the air is fresh and clear you can see Mt. Rainer in the back ground behind the Space Needle; however I was there in the summer so I just got a hazy view of Mt. Rainer. For the camera buffs I would advise you go to the park right after sun down so you can get a view of the Space Needle and the rest of Seattle all lit-up. If you want to change your daily wear visit Utilikilts on Pioneer Square. They can outfit you with a daily wear kilt in no time. I was much temped to buy one; however, well to be honest I chickened out. All and all the Pioneer Square Best Western Hotel is a great little hotel, right in the heart of old Seattle.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'I am new to Washington state, friends and circumstances have taken me to Seattle numerous times for overnite stay. I was lucky enough to find the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel for my travel arrangements. I have traveled all over the United States and Europe, I have to say this is the most pleasant hotel and staff I have ever encountered. Michael is always at the front desk to greet us, always smiling, professional and willing to LISTEN to the guests needs and wants. Very uncommon these days!!! The rooms are beautiful remodeled to the original era. The location is fantastic, walking to Pikes Market, the ferrys, surrounded by shops, restaurants and coffee houses. The lobby is very comfortable with great tourist information and a wonderful warming fire to sit and relax by. All of these wonderful attributes, make the Best Western at Pioneer Square in Seattle Wa., an absolute pleasure to continue my trips to Seattle. If it was not for the staff, Michael, in particular I may have stayed at an alternative hotel. In fact on my last trip, there was another hotel in the vacinity, same star value, cheaper in price and I would image other ways, I chose to stay at Best Western Pioneer Square without hesitation because of my wonderful experience. I would also like to mention Katarina, who is always pleasant with a big smile. You are very fortunate to have Michael, who obviously loves his job, torking for you. Thank you again for a wonderful experience!!! Wendy Whitehouse',\n",

It is located in the historic heart of Seattle and has several interesting places nearby, including Pioneer Square itself with its native American totem poles, the Klondyke Goldrush Museum, several of Seattle's famous coffee houses and what must be one of the USA's finest bookshops. There is also a reasonable selection of restaurants within walking distance. The area is not too noisy and felt perfectly safe. The hotel itself is an older building with an individual and historical character. I prefer this style of hotel to very large, more modern but often bland hotels. My room was spacious, spotlessly clean and everything worked. I had suffered a sporting injury immediately before my visit and needed some special assistance, the staff were friendly and extremely helpful. There is no restaurant but there is a breakfast buffet - fairly simple items, cereals, yoghurt, waffles, etc. Sadly, the excellant selection of Torrefazione coffee from the store that used to be nearby is no longer available. This was another enjoyable stay and I would certainly stay there again if I travel to Seattle.\",\n",

       "   'Content': \"I was surprised to see how highly this hotel was rated, given the price, but after staying there I agree with all the reviews - SUPERB hotel for the money. The room was really spacious. Decor was OK, depending on what you like, but I don't choose hotels for decor anyway. Best part was the service - the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Also the breakfast was WONDERFUL. With most hotels this price, you just get a 'continental' breakfast - this one had the works: breads, bagels, cereal, fruit, juices, coffee, and a waffle machine! Great to be able to have a hearty breakfast before you're heading out for a day's sightseeing... My only criticism is that there may have been a lot of dust under the beds or somewhere, because my allergies were going nuts, but I can't say for sure that was the hotel's fault; it might have been something else triggering my allergies. Also, the parking is a block away (pay parking) but you can pull up in front of the hotel to unload your luggage, check in etc, and then move the car. And the parking lot does have in/out priveleges - you get a pass from the hotel and that way can come and go as you please. You pay for the pass as part of your hotel bill, so you don't have the hassle of paying separately. (I searched online for hotels with parking included, and there didn't seem to be any in this price range, so just remember to add on $20/day for parking. Which may seem a lot, but given how much street parking is, it's not too bad) Oh and somewhere it said there was WiFi, but it's not really WiFi, it's an internet port in your room. I would definitely stay here again.\",\n",

I was an easy and comfortable walking distance from everything. I like the fact that the Best Western in Pioneer Square is also walking distance from great restaurants: Italian, Middle Eastern, Thai, Sushi, Pho...all within two blocks of the hotel. The decor is a comfortable elegance. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is wireless service. A big plus because I\\'m often having to finish business during my stay. Downstairs there is also a computer so you can print out airline or train tickets. Again...a nice extra. I very much appreciated the morning self-serve breakfast of \"make your own waffles\", bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, and hard boiled eggs. It met all the needs of my somewhat picky eater kids. Finally, I\\'m an art lover. And I so appreciated being in the heart of the Art District. There are over 30 galleries and artist studios nearby. We happened to stay on an evening that was a \"First Thursday Art Walk\". The galleries stayed open until 8 PM and many of the artists were on hand to answer questions. The Seattle Art Museum is just a short bus or cab ride away. I have recommended the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel to all my family and friends.',\n",

I have been staying at the hotel at least once a year since it was renovated in the early 90's. A friend told me about its very competitive rates and close in location to the market/downtown as well as to the stadiums and waterfront. PSH is not the flashiest place in town, meal service is limited to a simple coffee/pastry service, but it is almost always the best value in town--the rooms are as nice as you see in the best western urban niche, and the staff and service are exceptional. I like that it is only a short walk to the the waterfront and stadium district while only a short cab ride to the market and downtown. Parking is limited and off site, but for the price savings it is never an issue to me. there is usually a lot going on in Pioneer Square and only on one Mardi Gras week have I ever found a little late night revelery to be noticed from my room. the best rooms are the ones with balcony's and I always stay in one of them.\",\n",

       "   'Content': \"My fiancee stayed in Seattle for a romantic three day two night stay. We looked for a hotel that was close enough to walk to our favorite spots within the city and decided to stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. It is within walking distance from both the Seattle Aquarium, Pike place market, and many great restaurants. Upon first arriving I had trouble working the card key lock but the bell hop was very friendly and assisted us getting into our room to relax. He finished showing us our room and quietly left us to start our night. Our wake up call came in on the dot which, for my hotel experience was rare but preferred. The continental breakfast was served pipping hot! Fresh Belgian waffles with coffee for my fiancee and myself. They had fresh fruit, yogurt and much more which we couldn't stuff ourselves with. However, I did sneak some fruit for later in the day. The staff was very polite and the food was never empty nor cold. After a day out we returned to a well turned down room. The front desk was more then happy to sneak a bottle of champagne into our room while we were out so I could surprise my fiancee per my request by phone. We relaxed in our room the remainder of the night. Our room had a balcony overseeing the front entrance which made it nice to watch the foot traffic of the city. After spending weekends at other hotels in the past, their prices never were justified with what we received. All of the Amenities at Pioneer Square Hotel were more then adequate and my fiancee will most definitely return. The room was superb, the staff was more then helpful, friend and went well above and beyond. If you plan on going to Seattle ANYTIME soon, I would highly recommend sneaking into this wonderful hotel and staying awhile. You won't regret it!\",\n",

       "   'Content': \"I had a really positive experience at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. The bed was very comfortable, which is a big plus for me. It was also very quiet. Perhaps it was the time of year, I don't know. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The concierge Greg is great! Very helpful and friendly. He greeted us with a smile and sent us off with one! I also really liked their extensive continental breakfast - the belgian waffles were a plus. It saved us money on eating breakfast out. I really appreciate that. One final note, Pioneer Square is one of the nicest parts of Seattle. It's unique, with streets lined with independent stores, and is filled with beautiful architecture. This hotel is right where you want to be. Right in Pioneer Square and very close to the waterfront (hint: eat at Ivar's Acres of Clams!!). I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Seattle.\",\n",

I also had a very last minute request...that there be something waiting in the room for my husband (card, balloons, wine, etc.). I was delighted when we arrived that the hotel staff greeted my husband with a \"Happy Birthday\" and when we entered our room there was a chilled bottle of sparkling wine awaiting us! It was perfect! We had a king bed in a city view room with a wonderful little balcony. It was a bit chilly, but we still managed to enjoy the balcony for awhile. The bed and pillows were great. No problems with the wireless internet. It was just a wonderful stay! We were within walking distance of everything...had a nice seafood dinner (McCormick & Schmick\\'s) and visited several breweries. We had fallen in love with this hotel on a previous visit (within walking distance to Qwest and Safeco!) so we knew of the perfect little martini bar (Martin\\'s Martini Heaven) just across the street from our hotel. Wonderful way to end the evening. Was a quick trip, but this hotel made it comfortable, relaxing, convenient, and romantic....just perfect!',\n",

       "   'Content': \"We were coming by train from Portland and the Best Western Pioneer Square is conveniently located, just a six block walk from the Amtrak station. Also a good location for exploring Seattle. It's easy to get to Pike Place Market Place, restaurants and downtown locations on foot or by bus. Pioneer Square is worth exploring and has a great bookstore, the Elliot Bay Book Company. What we didn't know before we got there is that there is an elevated freeway that runs above the part of the waterfront that is immediately west of the hotel. That area of the waterfront is, as a consequence, very noisy and not very attractive. We were there in July and it was hot enough that we needed the air conditioning provided by the room's older window unit. Thankfully, the air conditioner blocked the freeway noise. I wouldn't stay there at other times of year with nothing to block the noise. Since other reviewers describe their rooms as quiet, maybe there are quieter rooms further down Yesler street from the freeway. Or maybe some people are better at tuning out that kind of noise. Aside from the noisy location, this hotel was fine; clean, comfortable enough, reasonably priced when compared to other hotels further north. Breakfast was fine though nothing memorable.\",\n",

Pleasant staff and reception, apparantly family run and up to the usual Best Western standards, clean and well appointed. Several restaurants nearby but we suggest avoiding the closest, al Boccalino, a rather pretentious but unexceptional Italian 3 or 4 doors away. Expensive for what you get; we were told very offhandedly that they had no Washington wines.\" We are an Italian restaurant!\" At $60 to $100 for bottles one would pay no more than Â£10 for in a UK off licence- forget it.',\n",

We stayed for 4 nights, left to go to Victoria BC, then came back for 2 more nights. The hotel has \"old world\" charm. The room decor is very well done - down to the drapery, carpet and nice artwork on the walls. The bathrooms are modern and nicely sized. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms and bathrooms were spotless. The linens were fresh and spotless as well. The fresh fruit and free bottled water was a nice touch and very much appreciated. The breakfast room was clean and always stocked with the daily offerings. The coffee was good and the waffles were addicting. Even the elevator was fast and roomy. You don\\'t realize how much you appreciate that until you go to another hotel where the elevators are sloooooow and tiny (as they were in our Victoria BC hotel). The Pioneer Square area is lively and exciting with lots of little shops and restaurants. We walked around the area at night and didn\\'t feel unsafe. Other people mentioned street people as problematic. This is a fact of life in any large city, but none of the street people were aggressive or abusive. Just a block away, they offer a tour of Seattle Underground which was interesting. Pizza at Mario\\'s was delicious. Dinner at Elliott\\'s Oyster House at Pier 56 was wonderful. We found Seattle to be a great city with friendly people who are helpful and polite to tourists. We hope to visit again some day and when we do, we will again stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel.',\n",

This was orginally a muddy road that logs were dragged (skidded) up to get to Yesler's mill. Thus, the term skid row was was given to this area. Loggers and millworkers being lonely at times liked to frequent the business that sprung up around this area. They also got a bit thirsty!!! I previously lived in Seattle for about 15 years. I rode or walked by the hotel several times and never gave it a thought. Was looking for a hotel close to the train station, by the bus stop, and close to the waterfront. You step out the door of the hotel and turn left walk about a block and your at the ferry terminal on the waterfront. You walk out the hotel door and practically next door is the bus stop for FREE bus service within the Downtown core. The Klondike Gold Rush museum is also in the area. They sometimes offer free walking tours that include a trip to the top of the Smith Tower (originally the tallest building on the West Coast). If you walk north up 1st Ave about 6-7 blocks & at the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) and the Pike Place Market. The rooms were small, but the hotel was built in the early 1900. The room was immaculate, and because of something we were given an upgrade to a deluxe room with city view. We got in about 9pm and walked to the waterfront. Ivars is open until late. We found a really good deal. They extend their Happy Hour on Fridays til closing. Well drinks, wine are $3.00. Limited menu but I got fried oysters for $4.95, can get Fish & chips also for 4.95 with view table looking out as the ferry terminal. We will definely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle. The most beautiful city on the planet!!!!!\",\n",

But, they have a computer in the conference room downstairs for guests so not a big issue. The area in Pioneer Square was nice and to all of the shops we hit on 1st Ave. Despite some older reviews concerning the homeless people we never encountered any aggressive homeless person nor did we ever feel threatened. The restaurant next to the hotel (Julies Garden) was good with big portions. But, our spot was the Pho restaurant across the street from the hotel. We cant wait to come back to Seattle for another Seahawk/Mariner game. We will definitely stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square. John Phillips',\n",

Every thing was fine for us, excellent quality-price: - walking distance to most of the best attractions such as Pioneer Square (historical square, but a bit spooky day & night), Pike Place Market (so lively, we met Rachel, the pig, and many many other Rachel all over the center... cute!), the Waterfront, the Business District, etc. - free bus to the other main attractions - free wireless Internet in our room (we highly appreciated!) - very courteous, and helpful personnel - free & light breakfast, very practical. The room was comfortable, big enough for 2 persons, tastefully decorated but not well organized (nice but too big furniture), especially the bathroom as someone else mentioned. Before checking at the hotel, we visited the University District, which is far from the center but worthwhile to visit by car (we came from Vancouver with a rented car - a 3 h drive). Immediately after checking (our room was not ready), we returned our car. The rented car office was, again, within walking distance from the hotel. We were glad to have done that because although the Hotel offers parking spaces, they were far from the hotel, and expensive, and we do not need a car to visit Seattle. Public transport seems very well organized at least during the week. Seattle is a pleasant city, easy to visit; people were really nice and helpful with us, tourists (as in Vancouver by the way). Terminal 30, where our ship, Sun Princess, docked was close (a short taxi drive), not far from the stadium. But do not think about walking there: it seems to me a labyrinth of highways... I would certainly return to this hotel, and recommend it, if it is less expensive than big hotels nearby, which in our case were anyway all full.',\n",

This hotel is the only one in Pioneer Square, and it is within walking distance of everything. In fact, it's across the street from the waterfront, which is a popular place to go walking and sightseeing. We never rented a car or taxi; didn't need one. Granted, we walked about 3-5 miles a day, but stopped anywhere we wanted along the way. You don't need a car in the city, and you have to call for taxis anyway...why not walk? The room was always clean, and a decent size for the two of us. It had a weird smell though, but it wasn't something we couldn't tolerate, though. It is very charming and cozy, and is within a few yards of great restaurants and bars. In fact, out of all the meals we ate, the restaurant next door, Al Boccalino's, was the best. They provide room service for the hotel, and they have some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Somewhat pricey, but it was SO good. Hotel staff were friendly, but not the most knowledgeable of all the questions I asked (such as, can they help with reservations for the Victoria Clipper, what bus # do we take to go to Ballard, etc.). But, they were very nice and always tried to help. The hotel was quiet when we were there, even though it seemed to be very crowded. I would recommend it to anyone. With our AAA membership, we paid $161 a night, except for Friday night, which was more expensive.\",\n",

High ceilings and warm appointments, room quality is excellent and spacious, particularly considering the architectural restrictions of an older building. Use the tiny elevators, or what the heck... climb the wide staircases... it's good for your heart. Step outside into the fun of day or night life in Seattle. You are one block from the waterfront and trolley, and one block from tons of buses. On the opposite end of town from the Space Needle, there are loads of stores, shops and eateries nearby. Bring comfy walking shoes. Down an alley next to the hotel, i.e., one block directly behind the hotel is a wonderful diner, complete with quaint vinyl booths, where you can get a tasty, filling and affordable breakfast. Get a good rate, and this hotel is a sure winner.\",\n",

To me, this area was pretty bad and I would walk around there alone (I am a woman). I would not feel safe there. Anyway, the hotel is pretty nice and the customer service is first rate. The room was very large but the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Great pillows but my body ached from sleeping in the very hard bed. The shower was the best part! Big and plenty of hot water!! I loved that part! Luckily I didn't have to pay for the room but it was pretty expensive - not worth the money to me. And, parking is a mess there - you have to park about 2 blocks away in this parking garage that is not run by the hotel. It is very inconveinant.....\",\n",

We had noticed what appeared to be vagrants sitting in the unattended lobby a couple of times, including the early morning were checking out. My wife left our bags for a moment to get a muffin at the continental breakfast and when she came back to the bags, her handbag was gone, and so was the fellow who was sitting across from her. I was at the counter checking out and didn't see anything, but I did see the suspicious fellow sitting in the lobby as I move our bags. The manager was not there, as it was a Sunday, and they have treated us like we're trying to pull a scam. They claim no liability for baggage untended, but they should at least take responsibility for making sure their lobby is clear of derelicts waiting to prey on their customers. From about 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. there is supposed to be someone at the front door, but outside those hours they have nobody there, and the clerks are unable to see who is coming in or leaving. The manager says they have security cameras, but I think she was bluffing to see if I backed off of our claims. None of the other employees there that morning knew of any cameras. Furthermore, the manager NEVER returned any of my calls as promised. We feel we've been treated disrespectfully, and none of our suggestions have been taken seriously (ie the need for full-time front-door concierge/security). That part of Seattle has really become full of vagrants. BEWARE!!\",\n",
